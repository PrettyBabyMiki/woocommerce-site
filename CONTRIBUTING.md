# How to contribute

Community made patches, localisations, bug reports and contributions are always welcome and are crucial to ensure WooCommerce remains the #1 eCommerce platform for WordPress ;)

When contributing please ensure you follow the guidelines below so that we can keep on top of things.

__Note:__

GitHub and Transifex are for *bug reports and contributions only* - if you have a support question or a request for a customization don't post here. Use [WooThemes Support](http://support.woothemes.com) for customer support, [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce) for community support, and for customisations we recommend one of the following services:

## Contribute to the core

### Reporting issues

Reporting issues is an easy way to became a contributor. It does not need technical skills, you don't need to know any programming language and you don't need to check the code. You only need to make sure that everything works as expected.

#### How to

If something is not working, congratulations! You found a bug! Help us fixing it by submitting an issue report.

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Search in the existing issues to be sure that one does not already exist.
* Submit a report for your issue.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.

### Making Changes

Making changes in the core is a great way to help us improving WooCommerce. You need some technical skills to make a change, like knowing the PHP language, CSS, SASS or JavaScript.

If you think that something could be improved and you are able to do so, make your changes and submit a Pull Request.

#### How to

* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Make the changes to your forked repository.
  * **Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/).**
  * Ensure you use LF line endings - no crazy Windows line endings. :)
* When committing, reference your issue number (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the master branch of the WooCommerce repository. Existing maintenance branches will be maintained of by WooCommerce developers.
* Please **don't** modify the changelog - this will be maintained by the WooCommerce developers.
* Please **don't** add your localizations or update the .pot files - this will be maintained by the WooCommerce developers. To contribute to the localization of WooCommerce, please join the [WooCommerce Transifex project](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/woocommerce/).

At this point you're waiting on us to merge your pull request. We review all pull requests, and make suggestions and changes if necessary.

## Contribute to the localisation

Localisation is a very important part of WooCommerce. When you localise WooCommerce, you are helping hundreds of people in the world, all the people who speak your language.

### Translating the core

We have a [public project on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/woocommerce/). You can join the localisation team of your language and help by translating WooCommerce.
If WooCommerce is already 100% translated for your language, don't worry, join the team anyway, we regularly update our language files, there will be need of your help soon.

### Translating the video tutorials

You can also help by translating our video tutorials. Check our [Video SRTs project](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/video-srts/) and join the team for your language. If it's not available, please request the new language and we will add it for you.

By translating our video tutorials you are helping all the non-english speaking users who are using WooCommerce for the first time. You are helping people to create their businesses and make their living by using WooCommerce.
