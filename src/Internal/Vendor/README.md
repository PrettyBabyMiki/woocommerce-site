## Vendor files directory

The contents of this directory are automatically generated by moving some of the packages in the `vendor` directory and prefixing the namespace of their classes with `Automattic\WooCommerce\Internal\Vendor`, right after `composer install/update` finishes. This is done to prevent conflicts with plugins using the same packages.

**Do no** make manual changes in the files here. Such changes will be lost the next time `composer install/update` runs.
