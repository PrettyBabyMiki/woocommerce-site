Upgraded react-router-dom to v6, which itself causes breaking changes. This upgrade will require consumers to also upgrade their react-router-dom to v6. #33156

BREAKING CHANGE:  
- the returned object from getHistory() has methods changed: goBack() -> back() and goForward() -> forward() 
- the listen() method from the returned object of getHistory() now takes a listener with an object parameter, ({location, action}) instead of (location, action)
- location.pathname is now validated and makes a warning if it is not a string
