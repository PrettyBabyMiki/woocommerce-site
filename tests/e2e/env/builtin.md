# Using the Built In Container for End to End Testing

This document provides general instructions for using `@woocommerce/e2e-environment` with the built in hosting container. 

## Prerequisites

Complete the [setup instructions](./README.md) in each project/repository.

## Initialization Requirements

The test sequencer uses a `ready` page to determine that the testing environment is ready for testing. This page is created by the built in initialization. It matches the following spec:

```
wp post create --post_type=page --post_status=publish --post_title='Ready' --post_content='E2E-tests.'
```

### Project Initialization

Each project will have its own begin test state and initialization script. For example, a project might start testing expecting that the [sample products](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/tree/master/sample-data) have already been imported. Below is the WP CLI equivalent of the built in initialization script for WooCommerce Core E2E testing:


```
wp core install --url=http://localhost:8084 --admin_user=admin --admin_password=password --admin_email=wooadmin@example.org
```

Project specific initialization can be added through an executable file at ```tests/e2e/docker/initialize.sh```. WooCommerce core's script is:


```
#!/bin/bash

echo "Initializing WooCommerce E2E"

wp plugin activate woocommerce
wp theme install twentynineteen --activate
```

### Container Configuration

The built in container initialization needs to know the particulars of your test install to run the tests. The built in uses the following default settings:

```
{
  "url": "http://localhost:8084/",
  "appName": "{repository-folder-name}",
  "users": {
    "admin": {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "password",
      "email": "admin@woocommercecoree2etestsuite.com"
    },
    "customer": {
      "username": "customer",
      "password": "password",
      "email": "customer@woocommercecoree2etestsuite.com"
    }
  }
}
```

You can override these in `/tests/e2e/config/default.json`.

- The `appName` entry is optional. If present, it is used as a prefix for the docker container names.
- The `customer` entry is not required by the sequencer but is required for the core test suite.
- The test sequencer does not use the user account email addresses.

```
{
  "url": "http://localhost:8089/",
  "users": {
    "admin": {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "password",
    },
    "customer": {
      "username": "customer",
      "password": "password",
    }
  }
}
```

### Folder Mapping

The built in container defaults to mapping the root folder of the repository to a folder in the `plugins` folder. For example `woocommerce` is mapped to `/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce`. Use the `WC_E2E_FOLDER_MAPPING` environment variable to override this mapping.

- Storefront Theme - ```WC_E2E_FOLDER_MAPPING=/var/www/html/wp-content/themes/storefront npm explore @woocommerce/e2e-environment -- npm run docker:up```
- Site Project - ```WC_E2E_FOLDER_MAPPING=/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins npm explore @woocommerce/e2e-environment -- npm run docker:up```

### Travis CI Supported Versions

Travis CI uses environment variables to allow control of some software versions in the testing environment. The built in container supports these variables:

- `WP_VERSION` - WordPress (default `latest`)
- `TRAVIS_PHP_VERSION` - PHP (default `latest`)
- `TRAVIS_MARIADB_VERSION` - MariaDB (default `latest`)

### Travis CI

To enable Travis CI testing in your repository add the following to the appropriate sections of your `.travis.yml` config file.

```yaml
version: ~> 1.0

  include:
    - name: "Core E2E Tests"
    php: 7.4
    env: WP_VERSION=latest WP_MULTISITE=0 RUN_E2E=1

....

script:
  - npm install jest --global
  - npm explore @woocommerce/e2e-environment -- npm run docker:up
  - npm explore @woocommerce/e2e-environment -- npm run test:e2e

....

after_script:
  - npm explore @woocommerce/e2e-environment -- npm run docker:down
```
