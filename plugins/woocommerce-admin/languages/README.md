## Generating POT

The generated POT template file is not included in this repository. To create this file locally, follow instructions from [README.md](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-admin/blob/master/README.md) to install the project, then run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

After the build completes, you'll find a `woocommerce-admin.pot` strings file in this directory.
