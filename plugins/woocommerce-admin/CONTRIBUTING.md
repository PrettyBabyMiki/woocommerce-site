# Contributing to WooCommerce Admin

Hi! Thank you for your interest in contributing to WooCommerce Admin. We appreciate it.

There are many ways to contribute – reporting bugs, feature suggestions, and fixing bugs.

## Reporting Bugs, Asking Questions, Sending Suggestions

Open [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-admin/issues/), that's all. If you want to prefix the title with a “Question:”, “Bug:”, or the general area of the application, that would be helpful but is no means mandatory. If you have write access, add the appropriate labels.

If you're filing a bug, specific steps to reproduce are helpful. Please include what you expected to see and what happened instead.

## We're Here To Help

We encourage you to ask for help. We want your first experience with WooCommerce Admin to be a good one, so don't be shy. If you're wondering why something is the way it is, or how a decision was made, you can tag issues with [Type] Question or prefix them with “Question:”
