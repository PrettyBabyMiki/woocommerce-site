# WooCommerce Admin

This is a feature plugin for a modern, javascript-driven WooCommerce Admin experience.

## Prerequisites

[WordPress 5.3 or greater](https://wordpress.org/download/) and [WooCommerce 3.6.0 or greater](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) should be installed prior to activating the WooCommerce Admin feature plugin.

For better debugging, it's also recommended you add `define( 'SCRIPT_DEBUG', true );` to your wp-config. This will load the unminified version of all libraries, and specifically the development build of React.

## Development

After cloning the repo, install dependencies:

 - `npm install` to install JavaScript dependencies.
 - `composer install` to gather PHP dependencies.

Now you can build the files using one of these commands:

 - `npm run build` : Build a production version
 - `npm run dev` : Build a development version
 - `npm start` : Build a development version, watch files for changes
 - `npm run build:release` : Build a WordPress plugin ZIP file (`woocommerce-admin.zip` will be created in the repository root)

### Testing
#### End-to-end tests
Tests live in `./tests/e2e`. An existing build is required prior running, please refer to the section above for steps. E2E tests have their own Docker container to run the WordPress server. Start
the server using:
```
npm run docker:up
```
Run tests using:
```
npm run test:e2e-dev
```
or in headless mode:
```
npm run test:e2e
```
Run a single test by adding the file name:
```
npm run test:e2e-dev complete-onboarding-wizard.test.js

## Common Issues
If you're encountering any issue setting things up, chances are we have been there too. Please have a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-admin/wiki/Common-Issues) for a list of common problems.

## Privacy

If you have enabled WooCommerce usage tracking ( option `woocommerce_allow_tracking` ) then, in addition to the tracking described in https://woocommerce.com/usage-tracking/, this plugin also sends information about the actions that site administrators perform to Automattic - see https://automattic.com/privacy/#information-we-collect-automatically for more information.
