# Testing instructions

## Unreleased

## 2.1.0

### Navigation: Reset submenu before making Flyout #6396

-   Download and activate the MailChimp plugin.
-   Turn on Navigation at Settings > Advanced > Features
-   Return to the WP dashboard
-   Hover over WooCommerce and see the flyout menu appear
-   MailChimp should not be included.

### Email notes now are turned off by default #6324

-   Create a zip for testing with `npm run zip:test`.
-   Create a `jurassic.ninja` instance.
-   Upload the plugin and activate it.
-   Update the installation date (we need a 10-day old store). You can do it with an SQL statement like this (using the WP phpMyAdmin plugin):

```
UPDATE `wp_options` SET `option_value`=UNIX_TIMESTAMP(DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 10 day)) WHERE `option_name` = 'woocommerce_admin_install_timestamp';
```

-   Confirm that `woocommerce_merchant_email_notifications` was not set before by `core` with a SQL statement like:

```
DELETE FROM `wp_options` WHERE `wp_options`.`option_name` = 'woocommerce_merchant_email_notifications';
```

or with wp-cli:

```
wp option delete 'woocommerce_merchant_email_notifications';
```

-   Run the cron job `wc_admin_daily` (this tool can help [WP Crontrol](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crontrol/)).
    - Go to **Tools > Cron Events** and scroll down to the `wc_admin_daily`.
    -  Hover over the item and click `Edit` change the **Next Run** to `Now` and click `Update Event`.
    - It will redirect you to the cron event list, and `wc_admin_daily` should be near the top, if you wait 10 seconds and refresh the page the `wc_admin_daily` should be near the bottom again, this means it has been run, and scheduled again to run tomorrow.
-   You should have not received an email note.
-   Verify the note `wc-admin-add-first-product-note` was added in the DB and its `status` is `unactioned`. You can use a statement like this:

```
SELECT `status` FROM `wp_wc_admin_notes` WHERE `name` = 'wc-admin-add-first-product-note';
```

or with wp-cli:

```
wp db query 'SELECT status FROM wp_wc_admin_notes WHERE name = "wc-admin-add-first-product-note"' --skip-column-names
```

-   Run the cron again.
-   The note's status should continue being `unactioned`.
