# Experimental

This is a private package and will not be published for external use.

A collection of component imports and exports that are aliases for components transitioning from experimental to non-experimental.  This package prevents the component from being undefined when the `@wordpress/components` library version is unclear.

## Installation

Install the module

```bash
npm install @woocommerce/experimental --save
```

## Usage

Simply import the component name with the `__experimental` prefix.  If found, the non-experimental version will be imported and if not, this will fallback to the experimental version.

```jsx
import { Text } from '@woocommerce/experimental';

render() {
	return (
		<Text variant="title.small">
			â€¦
		</Text>
	);
}
```
