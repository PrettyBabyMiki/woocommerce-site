# ESLint Plugin

This is an [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) plugin including configurations and custom rules for WooCommerce development.

**Note:** This primarily extends the [`@wordpress/eslint-plugin/recommended`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/packages/eslint-plugin) ruleset and does not change any of the rules exposed on that plugin. As a base, all WooCommerce projects are expected to follow WordPress JavaScript Code Styles.

However, this ruleset does implement the following (which do not conflict with WordPress standards):

- prettier formatting (using `wp-prettier`)
- Dependency grouping (External and Internal) for dependencies in JavaScript files
- No yoda conditionals
- Radix argument required for `parseInt`.

## Installation

Install the module

```
npm install @woocommerce/eslint-plugin --save-dev
```

## Usage

To opt-in to the default configuration, extend your own project's `.eslintrc` file:

```
{
  "extends": [ "plugin:@woocommerce/eslint-plugin/recommended" ]
}
```

Refer to the [ESLint documentation on Shareable Configs](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs) for more information.

The `recommended` preset will include rules governing an ES2015+ environment, and includes rules from the [`@wordpress/eslint-plugin/recommended`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/packages/eslint-plugin) project.
