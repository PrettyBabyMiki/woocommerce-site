# How To Document Components

The documentation of components via the docsify site is deprecated now, please use Storybook stories to document new components.
For instructions on documenting components with Storybook CSF, please see the documentation [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf).

To view the Storybook components in development then you can run `npm run storybook`.
