        Please try testing your site for theme and plugins conflict. 
        To do that deactivate all plugins except for WooCommerce and WooCommerce Beta Tester and switch to a default WordPress theme or [Storefront](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/themes/storefront/). Then test again. 
        If the issue is resolved with the default theme and all plugins deactivated, it means that one of your plugins or a theme is causing the issue. 
        You will then need to enable it one by one and test every time you do that in order to figure out which plugin is causing the issue.
      options:
        - label: I have deactivated other plugins and confirmed this bug occurs when only WooCommerce and WooCommerce Beta Tester plugins are active.
        - label: This bug happens with a default WordPress theme active, or [Storefront](https://woocommerce.com/storefront/).
        - label: I can reproduce this bug consistently using the steps above.
